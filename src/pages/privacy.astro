                  <strong>TL;DR:</strong> <br />
                  We only collect what we need to run a great conference. No
                  creepy tracking, no selling your data, no spam. You're in
                  control. <br /><br /><b>That's it.</b>
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>Why this exists</h3>
              <p>
                Privacy policies are usually terrible to read. We get it. But EU
                law (GDPR) requires us to tell you how we handle your data. So
                we've tried to make this as painless as possible. Grab a coffee and let's go.

                  your badge, you're giving them permission to contact you after the
                  event about their products or services. Don't want follow-ups? Don't
                  let them scan your badge. Questions about how an exhibitor uses your
