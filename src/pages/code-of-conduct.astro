          <h2>1. Respect</h2>
          <p>
            Mac Admins Europe is an inclusive environment based on treating all individuals respectfully, 
            regardless of any protected characteristics.
          </p>
          <p>Respectful behavior includes:</p>
          <ul class="coc-list">

            If you're unclear whether a communication or action is respectful, ask a conference organizer. 
            We'd rather hear from you than hear about something after the fact.

          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="coc-section">
          <h2>3. Privacy</h2>

            Respect the privacy of fellow attendees. You must not reveal personally identifying information 
            about any participant without their consent, including:

        </div>

        <div class="coc-section">
          <h2>4. Be Considerate</h2>
          <p>
            This is a diverse community with many different humans from various backgrounds and experience levels. 
            Before engaging in discussions:
          </p>
          <ul class="coc-list">
            <li>Listen first and understand the context</li>
            <li>Recognize that advice from one person reflects their experience, not absolute truth</li>
            <li>Be patient with newcomers and those learning</li>
            <li>Remember that we all continue to learn at every level of expertise</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="coc-section">
          <h2>5. Be Authentic</h2>
          <p>
            It is forbidden to impersonate an individual or pretend to represent a company. 
            Be genuine in your interactions and represent yourself honestly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="coc-section">
          <h2>6. Resolve Peacefully</h2>
          <p>
            We believe that peer-to-peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, 
            safer, and more welcoming community.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you see someone violating this Code of Conduct, you may respectfully point them to the specific 
            part they are violating. Do not engage in arguments — contact an organizer if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, 
            and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and how you handle mistakes matters.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="coc-section">
          <h2>7. Reporting Incidents</h2>
          <p>
            If you feel that you are being harassed and feel comfortable speaking with the offender, 
            please inform them that they have affected you negatively. Often, the offending behavior is unintentional.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't feel comfortable speaking directly with the offender <strong>for any reason</strong>, 
            please report violations directly to a conference organizer. Conference staff can be identified by their staff badges.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also reach us via email at <a href="mailto:conduct@macadmins-eu.org">conduct@macadmins-eu.org</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conference staff will help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, 
            provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="coc-section">
          <h2>8. Consequences</h2>
          <p>
            If the organizers determine that a participant is violating any part of this Code of Conduct, 
            they may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the conference 
            without a refund.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. 
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
